\chapter{Methods}
\label{cha:methods}
In this chapter, firstly, the Natural Language Processing methods used in this work are described in detail. Secondly, the aforementioned sub-components are analyzed.

\section{The \textit{Body Part Finder}}
\label{sec:body_part_finder}
\subsection{The body part list}
The objective of this component is to identify body parts words within the patient's sentence. For this goal, it is necessary to have a list of body parts. In addition, each body part can be expressed by the patient using a large variety of terms: its synonyms. Hence, with the addition of an abstraction layer, the list of body parts becomes a list of body parts concepts. Each body part concept is then associated to a list of its synonyms. 

Another problem to face is that the language of the body parts classification should be understandable by every patient: therefore, it has to be informal and not strictly technical.

At the moment, it is not available any body part classification with these features. Therefore, a new classification based on the list of body parts found in \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary\_of\_medicine} \cite{bodypartswiki} has been produced by the author. The classification is saved in a \texttt{.csv} file.

\subsection{Finding a body part in a sentence}
Finding a body part in a sentence is trivial if it is available an exhaustive list of body parts and the respective synonyms. The code does a simple string matching between each word in the sentence and each synonym present inside the classification. This approach has some drawbacks: for example, the word “back” can be both a preposition and a body part. Therefore, taking in consideration only words may lead to forget the context: this might introduce misunderstandings, lowering the quality of the results.

\section{Question Answering system}
\label{sec:qa_system}
The outcome of the \textit{Body Part Finder} is then passed to the \textit{QA system}. Its aim is highlighting, in the patient's sentence, the words that answers to a set of questions like \textit{What are the symptoms in the sentence?} or \textit{What is the problem with the neck?}. This task is called in literature \textit{Machine Reading Comprehension} \cite{rnet}.

\subsection{Types of questions}
The questions asked to the specified model over each sentence can be of two types:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item generic question about the symptoms in the sentence: \textit{What are the symptoms?}
  \item specific question about the problem of a found body part in the sentence: \textit{What is the problem with the }\texttt{[body part]}\textit{?}
\end{enumerate}

The question over the symptoms is intentionally generic because its scope is to catch the majority of the symptoms within the sentence. Thus, as shown in section \ref{sec:answer_interpreter}, the answer to this question must be interpreted.

At the same time, the question over a body part is deliberately specific. The logic behind this question is that if a patient refers to a body part during the interview, it can be the source of a problem.

Figure \ref{fig:qa} shows the whole component.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:qa}, two problems may arise: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the model can sometimes provide a useful answer but too generic (this is the case of \textit{small bumps})
  \item it might provide redundant answers, increasing unnecessarily the number of predictions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{How to evaluate predictions?}
\label{sec:eval_results}
Once predictions are computed, the objective is to evaluate them. This process is contextual to the sentence and it is based on a list of $m$ predictions ($[CUI_{p}1, CUI_{p}2, ..., CUI_{p}m]$) and a list of $n$ \emph{real CUIs} ($[CUI_{s}1, CUI_{s}2, ..., CUI_{s}n]$), that are the actual symptoms present in the sentence.

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:cla_symp}, the relationships between every child and every father are of type \textit{is-a}. This means that a child symptom is always a specialization of its father; in other words, the child can be viewed as a subset of its father. Thus, a prediction is considered correct if it is located within a subtree rooted in any of the real CUIs.

\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}
%TODO prima persona
As mentioned in section \ref{datasetintro}, in order to create a suitable dataset for this project, the sentences extracted from a medical forum were linked to one or more symptoms. The used forum is \footnote{\url{https://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/}} \cite{doctorslounge} and it classifies its posts by topic. The extraction and tagging process focused on six categories:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item chest;
  \item ear, nose and throat;
  \item eyes;
  \item gastroenteric symptoms;
  \item headaches;
  \item pediatric symptoms;
  \item back.
\end{enumerate}

Extrapolating a sentence within a post firstly means finding a passage in it which contains an identifiable and classifiable symptom and, secondly, tagging it with the relative CUI. The dataset's format is a \texttt{XML} with two types of tags: the \texttt{<sentence>} tag and the \texttt{<symptom>} tag, which has an attribute \texttt{CUI} used for linking the CUI to the symptom text.
