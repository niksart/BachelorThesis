The aim of this component is taking the \textit{tokens for predictions} (outcome of Answer Interpreter) and with the help of the Vectorifier, output the most similar symptom's CUI.

In order to do this, each symptom inside the classification must have its representative vector of the same type and dimension of the embedding of the \textit{token for prediction}. Since each symptom in the classification has a descriptive field, called ``concept name'', I treated it like a sentence and I choose to use its vectorization as representative vector. In order to hasten the whole process at runtime I pre-computed these representative vectors for each supported type and dimension.

\subsection{The Symptom Tree}
As mentioned in section \ref{sec:cla_symp}, a suitable data structure for representing the symptom classification is a tree. In the UMLS system this hierarchy is stored with a parent array representation. The Python library that I used for this purpose is ``anytree''.

During the construction of the tree I tagged some nodes as related with a specific body part. This is helpful during mapping: given a \textit{token for prediction} that contains a body part, the search of the correct symptom is then circumscribed only to some subtrees.
