%%%%%%% USEFUL FOR FUTURE WORK
% For example, there is no explicit concept for a "third degree burn of left index finger caused by hot water". However, using the compositional syntax it can be represented as:

% \begin{verbatim}
%    284196006 | burn of skin | :
%    116676008 | associated morphology | = 80247002 | third degree burn injury |
%  , 272741003 | laterality | = 7771000 | left |
%  , 246075003 | causative agent | = 47448006 | hot water |
%  , 363698007 | finding site | = 83738005 | index finger structure
% \end{verbatim}
%
% BACK is both a preposition and a body part, then using contextual embeddings like bert finetuned or elmo embeddings could provide better results

classification is medical, create a patient level classification => vectors representations of symptoms are too weak
